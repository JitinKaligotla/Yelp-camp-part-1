We are doing a project yelp camp, which covers all the topics and technologies of web development
.To make ous understand and see the changes of each technology and  js packages will make , I am dividing the yelp camp into various parts
in the first part (Yelp camp part 1) you will see  our project with simple database (MongoDB) and js packages like express,node 
.Make sure u type npm install before running the code 
,This command makes sure to install all the dependencies we are using by automatically
I am not providing package.json , package-lock.json , node and node modules files , so make sure you first create your own a package.json file with using npm init command and install all the packages at a go using npm install and after installing all the packages you will get your node and node modules.
