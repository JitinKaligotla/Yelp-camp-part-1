We are doing a project yelp camp, which covers all the topics of web development
To make ous understand and see the changes of each technology and  js packages, I am dividing the yelp camp into various parts
in the first part (Yelp camp part 1) you will see just our project with simple database(MongoDB) and js packages like express,node 
Make sure u should type --> npm init <-- before running the code 
This command makes sure to install all the packages we are using by automatically
